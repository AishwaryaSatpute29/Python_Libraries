# Python Libraries: NumPy and Pandas
 This repository contains detailed practice scripts for two of the most essential Python libraries in Data Science and Machine Learning: NumPy and Pandas.
## ðŸ“š Contents
## 1. numpy.py â€” NumPy: Numerical Python
Topics Covered:

  - Introduction to NumPy Arrays
   
  -  Data Types, Type Casting
   
  -  Mathematical Operations (Addition, Multiplication, Dot Product, Exponents)
    
  -  Array Indexing, Slicing, and Reshaping
   
  -  Array Iterations (nditer, ndenumerate)
   
  -  Array Copy vs Reference (copy(), ravel(), flatten())
   
  -  Special Arrays: zeros, ones, full, eye, identity
   
  -  Random Number Generation (rand, randint, randn, ranf)
   
  -  Statistics Functions: mean, median, std, var, mode
   
  -  Trigonometric Functions: sin, cos, tan, deg2rad, rad2deg
   
  -  Logarithmic Functions: log, log2, log10

Linear Algebra:

  -  Solving Linear Equations (linalg.solve)
     
  -  Matrix Inversion (linalg.inv)
     
  -  Finding Roots (polynomial.Polynomial)
     
  -  Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (linalg.eig)
     
-  Practical Examples with Image Processing, Deep Learning references (OpenCV, TensorFlow)



## 2. pandas.py â€” Pandas: Data Analysis Library
Topics Covered:

 ## - DataFrame and Series Creation:
  
 ## - Accessing Data:

       - iloc (Index based selection)
        
       - loc (Label based selection)
        
       - Single and Multiple Column Selection
        
       - Head and Tail Operations

## - Handling Missing Values:

       - Detecting (isna(), isnull())
        
       - Dropping (dropna())
        
       - Filling (fillna())

## - Data Exploration:

        - Data Types, Info, Describe
         
        - Statistical Summary (mean, median, mode, variance, std deviation, quantiles)

- Iterating over DataFrames (items, iteritems, iterrows)

- Converting between NumPy arrays, Lists, and DataFrames

- Data Cleaning Techniques

- Working with real-world datasets like IPL Matches, Diabetes Dataset

# ðŸ’» Usage
These scripts are primarily for Practice purposes:

 - Practice hands-on NumPy and Pandas operations.
 
 - Understand core concepts used in Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
 
 - Modify the examples to fit your learning style or project needs.
